  "description": "*Huge Announcement* üëâ My next book is here: $100M Money Models\nRegister free & get big free stuff here: https://register.acq.com\n\nI‚Äôm releasing it live at a virtual book launch event in 6 weeks, on Sat Aug 16.\nWhat you need to know:\nA good money model gets you more customers, to spend more money, in less time, over and over again\nBusinesses that have good money models beat businesses that don't - in every industry\nIf you don‚Äôt have one, the business will fail on a long enough time horizon\nIf you do, it gives you the one thing that keeps a business going: cash flow\n\n*What you‚Äôll get for registering*‚ÜíAccess to 4 amazing free bonuses should you upgrade to VIP for the event (by just pre-ordering a copy of the book). The 4th bonus is absurd.\n\n*What you don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs going to happen at the live launch*‚ÜíA lot. And you will like it. Expect fireworks.\n\nRegister here for free https://register.acq.com\n\nSee you there.\n\nPS - Every person who shows up live gets a secret project I‚Äôve been working on for 2+ years. It's better than an NFT and less than a bitcoin. It is not a ‚Äúfree bonus‚Äù it is a paid product. But you will only get one - if you are there live.\n\nDISCLOSURE \nInformation shared here is for educational purposes only.
